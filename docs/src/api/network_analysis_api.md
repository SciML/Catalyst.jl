Note, currently API functions for network analysis and conservation law analysis
do not work with constant species (which are generated by SBML, and can be [declared
in Catalyst as well](@ref dsl_advanced_options_constant_species)).

For more information about these functions, please see the sections of the docs on
[network ODE representation](@ref network_analysis_odes) and [chemical reaction network theory](@ref network_analysis_structural_aspects).
