# [Smoluchowski Coagulation Equation](@id smoluchowski_coagulation_equation)

This tutorial shows how to programmatically construct a [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) corresponding to the chemistry underlying the [Smoluchowski coagulation model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoluchowski_coagulation_equation) using [ModelingToolkit](http://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/)/[Catalyst](http://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/). A jump process version of the model is then constructed from the [`ReactionSystem`](@ref), and compared to the model's analytical solution obtained by the [method of Scott](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/25/1/1520-0469_1968_025_0054_asocdc_2_0_co_2.xml) (see also [3](https://doi.org/10.1006/jcph.2002.7017)).

The Smoluchowski coagulation equation describes a system of reactions in which monomers may collide to form dimers, monomers and dimers may collide to form trimers, and so on. This models a variety of chemical/physical processes, including polymerization and flocculation.

We begin by importing some necessary packages.

```@example smcoag1
using ModelingToolkit, Catalyst, LinearAlgebra
using JumpProcesses
using Plots, SpecialFunctions
```

Suppose the maximum cluster size is `N`. We assume an initial concentration of monomers, `Nₒ`, and let `uₒ` denote the initial number of monomers in the system. We have `nr` total reactions, and label by `V` the bulk volume of the system (which plays an important role in the calculation of rate laws since we have bimolecular reactions). Our basic parameters are then

```@example smcoag1
# maximum cluster size
N = 10

# volume of a monomers in cm³
Vₒ = (4π / 3) * (10e-06 * 100)^3

# initial conc. = (No. of init. monomers) / bulk volume
Nₒ = 1e-06 / Vₒ

# No. of monomers initially
uₒ = 10000

# Bulk volume of system in cm³
V = uₒ / Nₒ
n = floor(Int, N / 2)

# No. of forward reactions
nr = ((N % 2) == 0) ? (n*(n + 1) - n) : (n*(n + 1))
nothing #hide
```

The [Smoluchowski coagulation equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoluchowski_coagulation_equation) Wikipedia page illustrates the set of possible reactions that can occur. We can easily enumerate the `pair`s of multimer reactants that can combine when allowing a maximal cluster size of `N` monomers. We initialize the volumes of the reactant multimers as `volᵢ` and `volⱼ`

```@example smcoag1
# possible pairs of reactant multimers
pair = []
for i = 2:N
    halfi = floor(Int, i/2)
    push!(pair, [(1:halfi)  (i .- (1:halfi))])
end
pair = vcat(pair...)
vᵢ = @view pair[:, 1]  # Reactant 1 indices
vⱼ = @view pair[:, 2]  # Reactant 2 indices
volᵢ = Vₒ * vᵢ         # cm⁻³
volⱼ = Vₒ * vⱼ         # cm⁻³
sum_vᵢvⱼ = @. vᵢ + vⱼ  # Product index
nothing #hide
```

We next specify the rates (i.e. kernel) at which reactants collide to form products. For simplicity, we allow a user-selected additive kernel or constant kernel. The constants(`B` and `C`) are adopted from Scott's paper [2](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/25/1/1520-0469_1968_025_0054_asocdc_2_0_co_2.xml)

```@example smcoag1
# set i to  1 for additive kernel, 2  for constant
i = 1
if i == 1
    B = 1.53e03    # s⁻¹

    # dividing by volume as it is a bimolecular reaction chain
    kv = @. B * (volᵢ + volⱼ) / V
elseif i==2
    C = 1.84e-04    # cm³ s⁻¹
    kv = fill(C / V, nr)
end
nothing #hide
```

We'll set the parameters and the initial condition that only monomers are present at ``t=0`` in `u₀map`.

```@example smcoag1
# k is a vector of the parameters, with values given by the vector kv
@parameters k[1:nr] = kv

# create the vector of species X_1,...,X_N
t = default_t()
@species (X(t))[1:N]

# time span
if i == 1
    tspan = (0.0, 2000.0)
elseif i == 2
    tspan = (0.0, 350.0)
end

 # initial condition of monomers
u₀    = zeros(Int64, N)
u₀[1] = uₒ
u₀map = Pair.(collect(X), u₀)   # map species to its initial value
nothing #hide
```

Here we generate the reactions programmatically. We systematically create Catalyst `Reaction`s for each possible reaction shown in the figure on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoluchowski_coagulation_equation). When `vᵢ[n] == vⱼ[n]`, we set the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant multimer to two.

```@example smcoag1
# vector to store the Reactions in
rx = []
for n = 1:nr
    # for clusters of the same size, double the rate
    if (vᵢ[n] == vⱼ[n])
        push!(rx, Reaction(k[n], [X[vᵢ[n]]], [X[sum_vᵢvⱼ[n]]], [2], [1]))
    else
        push!(rx, Reaction(k[n], [X[vᵢ[n]], X[vⱼ[n]]], [X[sum_vᵢvⱼ[n]]],
                           [1, 1], [1]))
    end
end
@named rs = ReactionSystem(rx, t, collect(X), [k])
rs = complete(rs)
```

We now convert the [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) into a `ModelingToolkit.JumpSystem`, and solve it using Gillespie's direct method. For details on other possible solvers (SSAs), see the [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/types/jump_types/) documentation

```@example smcoag1
# solving the system
jinputs = JumpInputs(rs, u₀map, tspan)
jprob = JumpProblem(jinputs, Direct(); save_positions = (false, false))
jsol = solve(jprob; saveat = tspan[2] / 30)
nothing #hide
```

Lets check the results for the first three polymers/cluster sizes. We compare to the analytical solution for this system:

```@example smcoag1
# Results for first three polymers...i.e. monomers, dimers and trimers
v_res = [1; 2; 3]

# comparison with analytical solution
# we only plot the stochastic solution at a small number of points
# to ease distinguishing it from the exact solution
t   = jsol.t
sol = zeros(length(v_res), length(t))
if i == 1
    ϕ = @. 1 - exp(-B*Nₒ*Vₒ*t)
    for j in v_res
        sol[j,:] = @. Nₒ*(1 - ϕ)*(((j*ϕ)^(j-1))/gamma(j+1))*exp(-j*ϕ)
    end
elseif i == 2
    ϕ = @. (C*Nₒ*t)
    for j in v_res
        sol[j,:] = @. 4Nₒ*((ϕ^(j-1))/((ϕ + 2)^(j+1)))
    end
end

# plotting normalised concentration vs analytical solution
default(lw = 2, xlabel = "Time (sec)")
scatter(ϕ, jsol(t)[1,:] / uₒ, label = "X1 (monomers)", markercolor = :blue)
plot!(ϕ, sol[1,:]/Nₒ, line = (:dot,4,:blue), label="Analytical sol--X1")

scatter!(ϕ, jsol(t)[2,:] / uₒ, label = "X2 (dimers)", markercolor = :orange)
plot!(ϕ, sol[2,:] / Nₒ, line = (:dot, 4, :orange), label = "Analytical sol--X2")

scatter!(ϕ, jsol(t)[3,:] / uₒ, label = "X3 (trimers)", markercolor = :purple)
plot!(ϕ, sol[3,:] / Nₒ, line = (:dot, 4, :purple), label = "Analytical sol--X3",
      ylabel = "Normalized Concentration")
```
