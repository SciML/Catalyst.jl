## Reaction network generation and representation
Catalyst provides the [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro for generating a
complete network, stored as a [`ReactionSystem`](@ref), which in turn is
composed of [`Reaction`](@ref)s. `ReactionSystem`s can be converted to other
`ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem`s, including a `ModelingToolkit.ODESystem`,
`ModelingToolkit.SDESystem`, or `ModelingToolkit.JumpSystem`.

When using the [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro, Catalyst will automatically
attempt to detect what is a species and what is a parameter. Everything that
appear as a substrate or product in some reaction will be treated as a species,
while all remaining symbols will be considered parameters (corresponding to
those symbols that only appear within rate expressions and/or as stoichiometric
coefficients). I.e. in
```julia
rn = @reaction_network begin
    k*X, Y --> W
end
```
`Y` and `W` will all be classified as chemical species, while `k` and `X` will
be classified as parameters.

The [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) generated by the [`@reaction_network`](@ref) macro
is a `ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem` that symbolically represents a system of
chemical reactions. In some cases it can be convenient to bypass the macro and
directly generate a collection of symbolic [`Reaction`](@ref)s and a
corresponding [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) encapsulating them. Below we illustrate
with a simple SIR example how a system can be directly constructed, and
demonstrate how to then generate from the [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) and solve
corresponding chemical reaction ODE models, chemical Langevin equation SDE
models, and stochastic chemical kinetics jump process models.

```@example ex1
using Catalyst, OrdinaryDiffEq, StochasticDiffEq, JumpProcesses, Plots
t = default_t()
@parameters β γ
@species S(t) I(t) R(t)

rxs = [Reaction(β, [S,I], [I], [1,1], [2])
       Reaction(γ, [I], [R])]
@named rs = ReactionSystem(rxs, t)
rs = complete(rs)

u₀map    = [S => 999.0, I => 1.0, R => 0.0]
parammap = [β => 1/10000, γ => 0.01]
tspan    = (0.0, 250.0)

# solve as ODEs
odesys = convert(ODESystem, rs)
odesys = complete(odesys)
oprob = ODEProblem(odesys, u₀map, tspan, parammap)
sol = solve(oprob, Tsit5())
p1 = plot(sol, title = "ODE")

# solve as SDEs
sdesys = convert(SDESystem, rs)
sdesys = complete(sdesys)
sprob = SDEProblem(sdesys, u₀map, tspan, parammap)
sol = solve(sprob, EM(), dt=.01, saveat = 2.0)
p2 = plot(sol, title = "SDE")

# solve as jump process
jumpsys = convert(JumpSystem, rs)
jumpsys = complete(jumpsys)
u₀map    = [S => 999, I => 1, R => 0]
dprob = DiscreteProblem(jumpsys, u₀map, tspan, parammap)
jprob = JumpProblem(jumpsys, dprob, Direct(); save_positions = (false,false))
sol = solve(jprob, SSAStepper(), saveat = 2.0)
p3 = plot(sol, title = "jump")

plot(p1, p2, p3; layout = (3,1))

## [ModelingToolkit and Catalyst accessor functions](@id api_accessor_functions)
A [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) is an instance of a
`ModelingToolkit.AbstractTimeDependentSystem`, and has a number of fields that
can be accessed using the Catalyst API and the [ModelingToolkit.jl Abstract
System
Interface](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/basics/AbstractSystem/).
Below we overview these components.

There are three basic sets of convenience accessors that will return information
either from a top-level system, the top-level system and all sub-systems that
are also `ReactionSystem`s (i.e. the full reaction-network), or the top-level
system, all subs-systems, and all constraint systems (i.e. the full model). To
retrieve info from just a base [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) `rn`, ignoring
sub-systems of `rn`, one can use the ModelingToolkit accessors (these provide
direct access to the corresponding internal fields of the `ReactionSystem`)

* `ModelingToolkit.get_unknowns(rn)` is a vector that collects all the species
  defined within `rn`, ordered by species and then non-species variables.
* `Catalyst.get_species(rn)` is a vector of all the species variables in the system. The
  entries in `get_species(rn)` correspond to the first `length(get_species(rn))`
  components in `get_unknowns(rn)`.
* `ModelingToolkit.get_ps(rn)` is a vector that collects all the parameters
  defined *within* reactions in `rn`.
* `ModelingToolkit.get_eqs(rn)` is a vector that collects all the
  [`Reaction`](@ref)s and `Symbolics.Equation` defined within `rn`, ordering all
  `Reaction`s before `Equation`s.
* `Catalyst.get_rxs(rn)` is a vector of all the [`Reaction`](@ref)s in `rn`, and
  corresponds to the first `length(get_rxs(rn))` entries in `get_eqs(rn)`.
* `ModelingToolkit.get_iv(rn)` is the independent variable used in the system
  (usually `t` to represent time).
* `ModelingToolkit.get_systems(rn)` is a vector of all sub-systems of `rn`.
* `ModelingToolkit.get_defaults(rn)` is a dictionary of all the default values
  for parameters and species in `rn`.

The preceding accessors do not allocate, directly accessing internal fields of
the `ReactionSystem`.

To retrieve information from the full reaction network represented by a system
`rn`, which corresponds to information within both `rn` and all sub-systems, one
can call:

* `ModelingToolkit.unknowns(rn)` returns all species *and variables* across the
  system, *all sub-systems*, and all constraint systems. Species are ordered
  before non-species variables in `unknowns(rn)`, with the first `numspecies(rn)`
  entries in `unknowns(rn)` being the same as `species(rn)`.
* [`species(rn)`](@ref) is a vector collecting all the chemical species within
  the system and any sub-systems that are also `ReactionSystems`.
* `ModelingToolkit.parameters(rn)` returns all parameters across the
  system, *all sub-systems*, and all constraint systems.
* `ModelingToolkit.equations(rn)` returns all [`Reaction`](@ref)s and all
  `Symbolics.Equations` defined across the system, *all sub-systems*, and all
  constraint systems. `Reaction`s are ordered ahead of `Equation`s with the
  first `numreactions(rn)` entries in `equations(rn)` being the same as
  `reactions(rn)`.
* [`reactions(rn)`](@ref) is a vector of all the `Reaction`s within the system
  and any sub-systems that are also `ReactionSystem`s.

These accessors will generally allocate new arrays to store their output unless
there are no subsystems. In the latter case the usually return the same vector
as the corresponding `get_*` function.

Below we list the remainder of the Catalyst API accessor functions mentioned
above.

## Basic system properties
See [Programmatic Construction of Symbolic Reaction Systems](@ref
programmatic_CRN_construction) for examples and [ModelingToolkit and Catalyst

## [Functions to extend or modify a network](@id api_network_extension_and_modification)
`ReactionSystem`s can be programmatically extended using [`ModelingToolkit.extend`](@ref) and
[`ModelingToolkit.compose`](@ref).

```@docs
setdefaults!
ModelingToolkit.extend
ModelingToolkit.compose
Catalyst.flatten
```

## Network analysis and representations
Note, currently API functions for network analysis and conservation law analysis
do not work with constant species (currently only generated by SBMLToolkit).

## Network comparison
```@docs
==(rn1::Reaction, rn2::Reaction)
isequivalent
==(rn1::ReactionSystem, rn2::ReactionSystem)
```

## Network visualization
[Latexify](https://korsbo.github.io/Latexify.jl/stable/) can be used to convert
networks to LaTeX equations by
```julia
using Latexify
latexify(rn)
```
An optional argument, `form` allows using `latexify` to display a reaction
network's ODE (as generated by the reaction rate equation) or SDE (as generated
by the chemical Langevin equation) form:
```julia
latexify(rn; form=:ode)
```
```julia
latexify(rn; form=:sde)
```
(As of writing this, an upstream bug causes the SDE form to be erroneously
displayed as the ODE form)

Finally, another optional argument (`expand_functions=true`) automatically expands functions defined by Catalyst (such as `mm`). To disable this, set `expand_functions=false`.

If [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) is installed and commandline accessible, it
can be used to create and save network diagrams using [`Graph`](@ref) and
[`savegraph`](@ref).
```@docs
Graph
complexgraph
savegraph
```

## [Rate laws](@id api_rate_laws)
As the underlying [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) is comprised of `ModelingToolkit`
expressions, one can directly access the generated rate laws, and using
`ModelingToolkit` tooling generate functions or Julia `Expr`s from them.

```

## Utility functions

```

## [Spatial modelling](@id api_lattice_simulations)
The first step of spatial modelling is to create a so-called `LatticeReactionSystem`:
```@docs
LatticeReactionSystem
```

The following functions can be used to querying the properties of `LatticeReactionSystem`s:
```@docs
reactionsystem
spatial_reactions
lattice
num_verts
num_edges
num_species
spatial_species
vertex_parameters
edge_parameters
edge_iterator
is_transport_system
has_cartesian_lattice
has_masked_lattice
has_grid_lattice
has_graph_lattice
grid_size
grid_dims
get_lattice_graph
```
In addition, most accessor functions for normal `ReactionSystem`s (such as `species` and `parameters`) works when applied to `LatticeReactionSystem`s as well.

The following two helper functions can be used to create non-uniform parameter values.
```@docs
make_edge_p_values
make_directed_edge_values
```

The following functions can be used to access, or change, species or parameter values stored in problems, integrators, and solutions that are based on `LatticeReactionSystem`s.
```@docs
lat_getu
lat_setu!
lat_getp
lat_setp!
rebuild_lat_internals!
```

Finally, we provide the following helper functions to plot and animate spatial lattice simulations.
```@docs
lattice_plot
lattice_animation
lattice_kymograph
```
