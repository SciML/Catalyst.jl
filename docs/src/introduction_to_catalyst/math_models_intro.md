# [Mathematical Models Catalyst can Generate](@id math_models_in_catalyst)
We now describe the types of mathematical models that Catalyst can generate from
chemical reaction networks (CRNs), corresponding to reaction rate equation (RRE)
ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, Chemical Langevin equation (CLE)
stochastic differential equation (SDE) models, and stochastic chemical kinetics
(jump process) models. For each we show the abstract representations for the
models that Catalyst can support, along with concrete examples. Note that we
restrict ourselves to models involving only chemical reactions, and do not
consider more general models that Catalyst can support such as coupling in
non-reaction ODEs, algebraic equations, or events. Please see the broader
documentation for more details on how Catalyst supports such functionality.

!!! note
    This documentation assumes you have already read the [Introduction to Catalyst](@ref introduction_to_catalyst) tutorial.

## General Chemical Reaction Notation
Suppose we have a reaction network with ``K`` reactions and ``M`` species, with the species labeled by $S_1$, $S_2$, $\dots$, $S_M$. We denote by
```math
\mathbf{X}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} X_1(t) \\ \vdots \\ X_M(t)) \end{pmatrix}
```
the state vector for the amount of each species, i.e. $X_m(t)$ represents the amount of species $S_m$ at time $t$. This could be either a concentration or a count (i.e. "number of molecules" units), but for consistency between modeling representations we will assume the latter in the remainder of this introduction.

The $k$th chemical reaction is given by
```math
\alpha_1^k S_1 + \alpha_2^k S_2 + \dots \alpha_M^k S_M \to \beta_1^k S_1 + \beta_2^k S_2 + \dots \beta_M^k S_M
```
with $\alpha^k = (\alpha_1^k,\dots,\alpha_M^k)$ its substrate stoichiometry vector, $\beta^k = (\beta_1^k,\dots,\beta_M^k)$ its product stoichiometry vector, and $\nu^k = \beta^k - \alpha^k$ its net stoichiometry vector. $\nu^k$ corresponds to the change in $\mathbf{X}(t)$ when reaction $k$ occurs, i.e. $\mathbf{X}(t) \to \mathbf{X}(t) + \nu^k$. Along with the stoichiometry vectors, we assume each reaction has a reaction rate law (ODEs/SDEs) or propensity (jump process) function, $a_k(\mathbf{X}(t),t)$.

As explained in [the Catalyst introduction](@ref introduction_to_catalyst), for a mass action reaction where the preceding reaction has a fixed rate constant, $k$, this function would be the rate law
```math
a_k(\mathbf{X}(t)) = k \prod_{m=1}^M \frac{(X_m(t))^{\alpha_m^k}}{\alpha_m^k!},
```
for RRE ODE and CLE SDE models, and the propensity function
```math
a_k(\mathbf{X}(t)) = k \prod_{m=1}^M \frac{X_m(t) (X_m(t)-1) \dots (X_m(t)-\alpha_m^k+1)}{\alpha_m^k!},
```
for stochastic chemical kinetics jump process models.

### Rate Law vs. Propensity Example:
For the reaction $2A + B \overset{k}{\to} 3 C$ we would have
```math
\mathbf{X}(t) = (A(t), B(t), C(t))
```
with $\alpha_1 = 2$, $\alpha_2 = 1$, $\alpha_3 = 0$, $\beta_1 = 0$, $\beta_2 =
0$, $\beta_3 = 3$, $\nu_1 = -2$, $\nu_2 = -1$, and $\nu_3 = 3$. For an ODE/SDE
model we would have the rate law
```math
a(\mathbf{X}(t)) = \frac{k}{2} A^2 B
```
while for a jump process model we would have the propensity function
```math
a(\mathbf{X}(t)) = \frac{k}{2} A (A-1) B.
```

Note, if the combinatoric factors are already included in one's rate constants,
the implicit rescaling of rate constants can be disabled through use of the
`combinatoric_ratelaws = false` argument to [`Base.convert`](@ref) or whatever
Problem is being generated, i.e.
```julia
rn = @reaction_network ...
osys = convert(ODESystem, rn; combinatoric_ratelaws = false)
oprob = ODEProblem(osys, ...)

# or
oprob = ODEProblem(rn, ...; combinatoric_ratelaws = false)
```
In this case our ODE/SDE rate law would be
```math
a(\mathbf{X}(t)) = k A^2 B
```
while the jump process propensity function is
```math
a(\mathbf{X}(t)) = k A (A-1) B.
```

## Reaction Rate Equation (RRE) ODE Models
The RRE ODE models Catalyst creates for a general system correspond to the coupled system of ODEs given by
```math
\frac{d X_m}{dt} =\sum_{k=1}^K \nu_m^k a_k(\mathbf{X}(t),t), \quad m = 1,\dots,M.
```
These models can be generated by creating `ODEProblem`s from Catalyst `ReactionSystem`s, and solved using the solvers in [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl). Similarly, creating `NonlinearProblem`s or `SteadyStateProblem`s will generate the coupled algebraic system of steady-state equations associated with a RRE ODE model, i.e.
```math
0 =\sum_{k=1}^K \nu_m^k a_k(\bar{\mathbf{X}}), \quad m = 1,\dots,M
```
for a steady-state $\bar{\mathbf{X}}$. Note, here we have assumed the rate laws are [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(mathematics)) so that the equations are well-defined.

### RRE ODE Example
Let's see the generated ODEs for the following network
```@example math_examples
using Catalyst, ModelingToolkit, Latexify
rn = @reaction_network begin
    k₁, 2A + B --> 3C
    k₂, A --> 0
    k₃, 0 --> A
end
osys = convert(ODESystem, rn)
```
Likewise, the following drops the combinatoric scaling factors, giving unscaled ODEs
```@example math_examples
osys = convert(ODESystem, rn; combinatoric_ratelaws = false)
```

## Chemical Langevin Equation (CLE) SDE Models
The CLE SDE models Catalyst creates for a general system correspond to the coupled system of SDEs given by
```math
d X_m = \sum_{k=1}^K \nu_m^k a_k(\mathbf{X}(t),t) dt + \sum_{k=1}^K \nu_m^k \sqrt{a_k(\mathbf{X}(t),t)} dW_k(t), \quad m = 1,\dots,M,
```
where each $W_k(t)$ represents an independent, standard Brownian Motion. Realizations of these processes can be generated by creating `SDEProblem`s from Catalyst `ReactionSystem`s, and sampling the processes using the solvers in [StochasticDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/StochasticDiffEq.jl).

### CLE SDE Example
Consider the same network as above,
```julia
rn = @reaction_network begin
    k₁, 2A + B --> 3C
    k₂, A --> 0
    k₃, 0 --> A
end
```
We obtain the CLE SDEs
```math
\begin{align}
dA(t) &= \left(- k_1 A^{2} B - k_2 A + k_3 \right) dt
 - 2 \sqrt{\tfrac{k_1}{2} A^{2} B} \, dW_1(t)  - \sqrt{k_2 A} \, dW_2(t) + \sqrt{k_3} \, dW_3(t)
\\
dB(t) &= - \frac{k_1}{2} A^{2} B \, dt - \sqrt{\frac{k_1}{2} A^{2} B} \, dW_1(t) \\
dC(t) &= \frac{3}{2} k_1 A^{2} B \, dt + 3 \sqrt{\frac{k_1}{2} A^{2} B} \, dW_1(t).
\end{align}
```

## Stochastic Chemical Kinetics Jump Process Models
The stochastic chemical kinetics jump process models Catalyst creates for a general system correspond to the coupled system of jump processes, in the time change representation, given by
```math
X_m(t) = X_m(0) + \sum_{k=1}^K \nu_m^k Y_k\left( \int_{0}^t a_k(\mathbf{X}(s^-),s) \, ds \right), \quad m = 1,\dots,M.
```
Here each $Y_k(t)$ denotes an independent unit rate Poisson counting process with $Y_k(0) = 0$, which counts the number of times the $k$th reaction has occurred up to time $t$. Realizations of these processes can be generated by creating `JumpProblem`s from Catalyst `ReactionSystem`s, and sampling the processes using the solvers in [JumpProcesses.jl](https://github.com/SciML/JumpProcesses.jl).

Let $P(\mathbf{x},t) = \operatorname{Prob}[\mathbf{X}(t) = \mathbf{x}]$ represent the probability the state of the system, $\mathbf{X}(t)$, has the concrete value $\mathbf{x}$ at time $t$. The forward equation, i.e. Chemical Master Equation (CME), associated with $\mathbf{X}(t)$ is then the coupled system of ODEs over all possible values for $\mathbf{x}$ given by
```math
\frac{dP}{dt}(\mathbf{x},t) = \sum_{k=1}^k \left[ a_k(\mathbf{x} - \nu^k,t) P(\mathbf{x} - \nu^k,t) - a_k(\mathbf{x},t) P(\mathbf{x},t) \right].
```
While Catalyst does not currently support generating and solving for $P(\mathbf{x},t)$, for sufficiently small models the [FiniteStateProjection.jl](https://github.com/SciML/FiniteStateProjection.jl) package can be used to generate and solve such models directly from Catalyst [`ReactionSystem`](@ref)s.

### Stochastic Chemical Kinetics Jump Process Example
Consider the same network as above,
```julia
rn = @reaction_network begin
    k₁, 2A + B --> 3C
    k₂, A --> 0
    k₃, 0 --> A
end
```
The time change process representation would be
```math
\begin{align*}
A(t) &= A(0) - 2 Y_1\left( \frac{k_1}{2} \int_0^t A(s^-)(A(s^-)-1) B(s^-) \, ds \right) - Y_2 \left( k_2 \int_0^t A(s^-) \, ds \right) + Y_3 \left( k_3 t \right) \\
B(t) &= B(0) - Y_1\left( \frac{k_1}{2} \int_0^t A(s^-)(A(s^-)-1) B(s^-) \, ds \right) \\
C(t) &= C(0) + 3 Y_1\left( \frac{k_1}{2} \int_0^t A(s^-)(A(s^-)-1) B(s^-) \, ds \right),
\end{align*}
```
while the CME would be the coupled (infinite) system of ODEs over all realizable values of the non-negative integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ given by
```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{dP}{dt}(a,b,c,t) &= \left[\tfrac{k_1}{2} (a+2) (a+1) (b+1) P(a+2,b+1,c-3,t) - \tfrac{k_1}{2} a (a-1) b P(a,b,c,t)\right] \\
&\phantom{=} + \left[k_2 (a+1) P(a+1,b,c,t) - k_2 a P(a,b,c,t)\right] \\
&\phantom{=} + \left[k_3 P(a-1,b,c,t) - k_3 P(a,b,c,t)\right].
\end{align*}
```
If we initially have $A(0) = a_0$, $B(0) = b_0$, and $C(0) = c_0$ then we would have one ODE for each of possible state $(a,b,c)$ where $a \in \{0,1,\dots\}$ (i.e. $a$ can be any non-negative integer), $b \in \{0,1,\dots,b_0\}$, and $c \in \{c_0, c_0 + 1,\dots, c_0 + 3 b_0\}$. Other initial conditions would lead to different possible ranges for $a$, $b$, and $c$.
