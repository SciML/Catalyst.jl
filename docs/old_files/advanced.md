# The Reaction DSL - Advanced

This section covers some of the more advanced syntax and features for building
chemical reaction network models (still not very complicated!).

#### User defined functions in reaction rates

The reaction network DSL can "see" user defined functions that work with
ModelingToolkit. E.g., this is should work

```julia
myHill(x) = 2.0*x^3/(x^3+1.5^3)
rn = @reaction_network begin
  myHill(X), ∅ → X
end
```

In some cases, it may be necessary or desirable to register functions with
Symbolics.jl before their use in Catalyst, see the discussion
[here](https://symbolics.juliasymbolics.org/dev/manual/functions/).

#### Ignoring mass action kinetics

While generally one wants the reaction rate to use the law of mass action, so
the reaction

```julia
rn = @reaction_network begin
  k, X → ∅
end
```

occurs at the rate ``d[X]/dt = -k[X]``, it is possible to ignore this by using
any of the following non-filled arrows when declaring the reaction: `<=`, `⇐`, `⟽`,
`⇒`, `⟾`, `=>`, `⇔`, `⟺` (`<=>` currently not possible due to Julia language technical reasons). This means that the reaction

```julia
rn = @reaction_network begin
  k, X => ∅
end
```

will occur at rate ``d[X]/dt = -k`` (which might become a problem since ``[X]``
will be degraded at a constant rate even when very small or equal to 0).
