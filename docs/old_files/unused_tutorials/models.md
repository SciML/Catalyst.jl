# Model Simulation

Once created, a reaction network can be used as input to various problem types,
which can be solved by
[DifferentialEquations.jl](http://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/),
and more broadly used within [SciML](https://sciml.ai) packages.

#### Deterministic simulations using ODEs

A reaction network can be used as input to an `ODEProblem` instead of a
function, using

```julia
odeprob = ODEProblem(rn, args...; kwargs...)
```

E.g., a model can be created and solved using:

```julia
using DiffEqBase, OrdinaryDiffEq
rn = @reaction_network begin
  p, ∅ → X
  d, X → ∅
end
p = [1.0,2.0]
u0 = [0.1]
tspan = (0.,1.)
prob = ODEProblem(rn,u0,tspan,p)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
```

Here, the order of unknowns in `u0` and `p` matches the order that species and
parameters first appear within the DSL. They can also be determined by examining
the ordering within the `species(rn)` and `parameters` vectors, or accessed more
explicitly through the [`speciesmap(rn)`](@ref) and [`paramsmap(rn)`](@ref)
dictionaries, which map the Symbolics.jl `BasicSymbolic` corresponding to each
species or parameter to their integer id. The order can also be set manually
using the `@species` and `@parameters` DSL options (see [The Reaction
DSL](@ref)). Note, if no parameters are given in the
[`@reaction_network`](@ref), then `p` does not need to be provided.

We can then plot the solution using the solution plotting recipe:

```julia
using Plots
plot(sol, lw=2)
```

To solve for a steady state starting from the guess `u0`, one can use

```julia
using SteadyStateDiffEq
prob = SteadyStateProblem(rn,u0,p)
sol = solve(prob, SSRootfind())
```

or

```julia
prob = SteadyStateProblem(rn,u0,p)
sol = solve(prob, DynamicSS(Tsit5()))
```

#### Stochastic simulations using SDEs

In a similar way an SDE can be created using

```julia
using StochasticDiffEq
sdeprob = SDEProblem(rn, args...; kwargs...)
```

In this case the chemical Langevin equations (as derived in Gillespie, J. Chem.
Phys. 2000) will be used to generate stochastic differential equations.

#### Stochastic simulations using discrete stochastic simulation algorithms

Instead of solving SDEs, one can create a stochastic jump process model using
integer copy numbers and a discrete stochastic simulation algorithm (i.e.,
Gillespie Method or Kinetic Monte Carlo). This can be done using:

```julia
using JumpProcesses
rn = @reaction_network begin
  p, ∅ → X
  d, X → ∅
end p d
p = [1.0,2.0]
u0 = [10]
tspan = (0.,1.)
discrete_prob = DiscreteProblem(rn, u0, tspan, p)
jump_prob = JumpProblem(rn, discrete_prob, Direct())
sol = solve(jump_prob, SSAStepper())
```

Here, we used Gillespie's `Direct` method as the underlying stochastic simulation
algorithm. We get:

```julia
plot(sol, lw=2)
```

### [`Reaction`](@ref) fields

Each `Reaction` within `reactions(rn)` has a number of subfields. For `rx` a
`Reaction` we have:

- `rx.substrates`, a vector of ModelingToolkit expressions storing each
  substrate variable.
- `rx.products`, a vector of ModelingToolkit expressions storing each product
  variable.
- `rx.substoich`, a vector storing the corresponding stoichiometry of each
  substrate species in `rx.substrates`.
- `rx.prodstoich`, a vector storing the corresponding stoichiometry of each
  product species in `rx.products`.
- `rx.rate`, a `Number`, `ModelingToolkit.Sym`, or ModelingToolkit expression
  representing the reaction rate. E.g., for a reaction like `k*X, Y --> X+Y`,
  we'd have `rate = k*X`.
- `rx.netstoich`, a vector of pairs mapping the ModelingToolkit expression for
  each species that changes numbers by the reaction to how much it changes. E.g.,
  for `k, X + 2Y --> X + W`, we'd have `rx.netstoich = [Y(t) => -2, W(t) => 1]`.
- `rx.only_use_rate`, a boolean that is `true` if the reaction was made with
  non-filled arrows and should ignore mass action kinetics. `false` by default.
