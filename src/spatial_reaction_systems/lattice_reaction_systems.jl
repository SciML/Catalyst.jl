### Lattice Reaction Network Structure ###

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

A representation of a spatial system of chemical reactions on a discrete (lattice) space.

# Fields
$(FIELDS)

Arguments:
- `rs`: The non-spatial [`ReactionSystem`](@ref) model that is expanded to a spatial model.
- `srs`: A vector of spatial reactions. These provide the rules for how species may move spatially.
- `lattice`: Either a Cartesian grid, a masked grid, or a graph. This describes the discrete space
to which the non-spatial model is expanded.

Keyword Arguments:
- `diagonal_connections = false`: Only relevant for Cartesian and masked lattices. If `true`,
diagonally adjacent compartments are considered adjacent, and spatial reactions in between these
are possible.

Example:
```julia
# Fetch packages.
using Catalyst, OrdinaryDiffEqDefault
import CairoMakie

# Creates the `LatticeReactionSystem` model.
rs = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
diffusion_rx = @transport_reaction D X
lattice = CartesianGrid((5,5))
lrs = LatticeReactionSystem(rs, [diffusion_rx], lattice)

# Simulates the model (using ODE and jumps).
u0 = [:X => rand(5,5)]
tspan = (0.0, 1.0)
ps = [:p => 1.0, :d => 0.5, :D => 0.1]
oprob = ODEProblem(lrs, u0, tspan, ps)
osol = solve(oprob)

# Saves an animation of the solution to the file "lattice_animation.mp4".
lattice_animation(osol, :X, lrs, "lattice_animation.mp4")
```

Notes:
- Spatial modelling in Catalyst is still a work in progress, any feedback (or contributions) to this
is highly welcome.
- `LatticeReactionSystem`s are primarily intended to model systems in discrete space. Modelling
continuous space systems with them is possible, but requires the user to determine the discretisation
(the lattice). Better support for continuous space models is a work in progress.
- Catalyst contains extensive documentation on spatial modelling, which can be found [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/spatial_modelling/lattice_reaction_systems/).

### Edge Parameter Value Generators ###

"""
    make_edge_p_values(lrs::LatticeReactionSystem, make_edge_p_value::Function)

Generates edge parameter values for a lattice reaction system. Only work for (Cartesian or masked)
grid lattices (without diagonal adjacencies).

Input:
- `lrs`: The lattice reaction system for which values should be generated.
    - `make_edge_p_value`: a function describing a rule for generating the edge parameter values.

Output:
    - `ep_vals`: A sparse matrix of size (num_verts,num_verts) (where num_verts is the number of
    vertices in `lrs`). Here, `eps[i,j]` is filled only if there is an edge going from vertex i to
    vertex j. The value of `eps[i,j]` is determined by `make_edge_p_value`.

Here, `make_edge_p_value` should take two arguments, `src_vert` and `dst_vert`, which correspond to
the grid indices of an edge's source and destination vertices, respectively. It outputs a single value,
which is the value assigned to that edge.

Example:
    In the following example, we assign the value `0.1` to all edges, except for the one leading from
    vertex (1,1) to vertex (1,2), to which we assign the value `1.0`.
```julia
using Catalyst
rn = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
tr = @transport_reaction D X
lattice = CartesianGrid((5,5))

Generates edge parameter values for a lattice reaction system. Only work for (Cartesian or masked)
grid lattices (without diagonal adjacencies). Each dimension (x, and possibly y and z), and
direction has assigned its own constant edge parameter value.

Input:
    - `lrs`: The lattice reaction system for which values should be generated.
    - `x_vals::Tuple{T,T}`: The values in the increasing (from a lower x index to a higher x index)
    and decreasing (from a higher x index to a lower x index) direction along the x dimension.
    - `y_vals::Tuple{T,T}`: The values in the increasing and decreasing direction along the y dimension.
    Should only be used for 2 and 3-dimensional grids.
    - `z_vals::Tuple{T,T}`: The values in the increasing and decreasing direction along the z dimension.
    Should only be used for 3-dimensional grids.

Output:
    - `ep_vals`: A sparse matrix of size (num_verts,num_verts) (where num_verts is the number of
    vertices in `lrs`). Here, `eps[i,j]` is filled only if there is an edge going from vertex i to
    vertex j. The value of `eps[i,j]` is determined by the `x_vals`, `y_vals`, and `z_vals` Tuples,
    and vertices i and j's relative position in the grid.

It should be noted that two adjacent vertices will always be different in exactly a single dimension
(x, y, or z). The corresponding tuple determines which value is assigned.

Example:
    In the following example, we wish to have diffusion in the x dimension, but a constant flow from
    low y values to high y values (so not transportation from high to low y). We achieve it in the
    following manner:
```julia
using Catalyst
rn = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
tr = @transport_reaction D X
lattice = CartesianGrid((5,5))
lrs = LatticeReactionSystem(rn, [tr], lattice)

D_vals = make_directed_edge_values(lrs, (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.0))
```
Here, since we have a 2d grid, we only provide the first two Tuples to `make_directed_edge_values`.
